## 🗄️ Database Design

### 🧩 Key Entities and Relationships

| Entity | Important Fields | Description |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **User** | `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` | Users can be guests or hosts. Hosts can list properties. |
| **Property** | `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `owner_id` | Each property is owned by a user (host). |
| **Booking** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status` | A booking links a guest (user) to a property for a given time. |
| **Review** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment` | A user can leave a review for a property after booking. |
| **Payment** | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status` | Each payment is tied to a booking. |

### 🔗 Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.  
- Each **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.  
- A **Review** belongs to a **User** and a **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.

## 🔒 API Security

### 🧱 Key Security Measures
1. **Authentication** – Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) or session-based authentication to verify users securely.  
2. **Authorization** – Restrict access based on user roles (guest, host, admin). Only authorized users can perform specific actions.  
3. **Input Validation** – Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.  
4. **Rate Limiting** – Prevent API abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.  
5. **HTTPS/SSL** – Ensure encrypted communication between clients and the server.  

### 🛡️ Importance
- Protects **user data** from unauthorized access.  
- Secures **payment transactions** and personal information.  
- Prevents **malicious attacks** such as SQL injection and XSS.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### ⚡ What is CI/CD?
**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** automates the software development lifecycle by testing, integrating, and deploying code changes quickly and reliably.

### 💡 Why It’s Important
- Ensures consistent builds and deployments.  
- Reduces human error and speeds up delivery.  
- Enables faster feedback loops for developers.  

### 🧰 Tools
- **GitHub Actions** – Automate testing and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker** – Containerize applications for consistent deployment.  
- **Render / Vercel / AWS** – Platforms for hosting and automatic deployment.
